# FastBlake

A pure-JVM BLAKE3 implementation, optimised for throughput.

Status: **harness complete, implementations not written.** The comparison
pipeline — correctness and performance, four contenders — runs today. Two of the
four contenders are real; the two FastBlake ones are the work ahead.

```
./gradlew contenders   # what can run here, and why anything can't
./gradlew test         # conformance: every contender vs. the official vectors
./gradlew jmh          # the comparison table
```

## The contenders

| id | what it is | role |
|---|---|---|
| `commons` | Apache Commons Codec `Blake3`, scalar Java | The floor. Always available. |
| `rust` | Reference [`blake3`][crate] crate via FFM, SIMD, single-threaded | The ceiling. Optional. |
| `java-cpu` | FastBlake CPU — Vector API | **To build.** |
| `java-gpu` | FastBlake GPU — device offload | **Planned.** |

Everything is measured through one interface, `Blake3Engine`, so all four face
identical call shapes on identical bytes. Adding a contender is one class plus
one line in `Contenders` — no test or benchmark changes.

**Absence is never failure.** A contender that cannot run here — no Rust
toolchain, no GPU, not written yet — reports *why* and is skipped. A machine
with no Rust gets the same green build with one fewer column. That property is
tested, not assumed: breaking the crate build on purpose leaves `test` and `jmh`
passing with `rust` correctly reported as unavailable.

Commons Codec, JMH and the harness are all off the `main` source set. The
shipped jar has no dependencies and never will.

## Correctness first

A benchmark between implementations that compute different functions measures
nothing. So every contender is held to the **official BLAKE3 test vectors**,
vendored verbatim from the reference implementation:

```
src/harness/resources/blake3/test_vectors.json
  <- https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/blob/master/test_vectors/test_vectors.json
```

35 input lengths from 0 to 102,400 bytes, each checked in all three modes
(`hash`, `keyed_hash`, `derive_key`) at 131 bytes of extended output — long
enough to exercise the XOF path past the first output block. On top of that,
per contender:

- the one-shot 32-byte digest is a prefix of the extended output (this also
  exercises Rust's separate one-shot native entry point),
- every case re-hashed in chunk sizes 1/7/63/64/65/1023/1024/1025, straddling
  the 64-byte block and 1024-byte chunk boundaries where buffering bugs live,
- finalizing twice yields the same bytes and does not consume the state,
- a short output is a prefix of a long one,
- `reset()` returns to the initial state,
- input and output offsets are honoured without clobbering neighbouring bytes.

362 assertions with Rust present, 182 without.

## Benchmarks

Three call shapes, because they stress different things:

| benchmark | what it isolates |
|---|---|
| `oneShot` | Realistic call: fresh hasher per buffer. Includes setup and allocation. |
| `reusedInstance` | `reset()`-reuse. Raw compression throughput. |
| `streaming4k` | 4 KiB incremental updates — the file/socket shape, which punishes anything needing the whole input up front to parallelise. |

Sizes sweep `64, 1024, 16384, 262144, 4194304`. 64 B and 1 KiB sit at or below
BLAKE3's 1024-byte chunk boundary where per-call overhead dominates; 16 KiB is
the smallest input that can fill a 16-lane SIMD batch; the rest measure
steady-state throughput.

```bash
./gradlew jmh                                          # every available contender
./gradlew jmh -P'jmh.args=oneShot -p size=1048576 -f1' # one case, fast
./gradlew jmh -P'jmh.args=-p impl=rust,commons'        # pick contenders
./gradlew jmh -P'jmh.args=-rf json -rff build/x.json'  # machine-readable
```

JMH prints ns/op; the runner appends a MiB/s table with speedups against the
`commons` baseline. Naming an unavailable contender explicitly fails fast with
the reason, rather than running for ten minutes first.

<!-- RESULTS -->

## How the Rust contender is wired

`cargo build --release` produces a `cdylib` from `native/rust-blake3`, which the
JVM calls through the Foreign Function & Memory API. It is measured *in process*
— shelling out to `b3sum` would measure process startup and file I/O instead of
the hash.

Downcalls use `Linker.Option.critical(true)`, so heap `byte[]` buffers pass
straight through with no copy: Rust hashes the very same array the Java
contenders do. The cost is that GC cannot run during a call — fine for a
benchmark harness, not something to imitate in production code.

The crate pins `panic = "abort"` and leaves the `rayon` feature off, so it races
one core against one Java thread. `fb_abi_version` is checked at link time, so a
stale library is rejected rather than silently mismeasured.

Gradle's `cargoBuild` task is best-effort: missing cargo, a failed compile, or a
platform that produces no shared library each record a reason in
`build/native/rust-status.txt` and clear the staged library. The Java side treats
that directory as authoritative — a stale artifact in the crate's own `target/`
will **not** resurrect a contender the current build failed to produce.

## Next step

Implement `FastBlake` (currently an API skeleton whose methods throw), then
delete the `unavailableReason()` override in `JavaCpuEngine`. Conformance
against the official vectors, all three benchmark shapes, and the comparison
table are already wired and start producing numbers immediately.

The GPU contender comes later. BLAKE3 suits a GPU well — the tree structure
makes every 1 KiB chunk independent, so a large input decomposes into thousands
of parallel chunk compressions with only a small parent-node merge left. Expect
the mirror image of the CPU contenders: badly beaten on small inputs where
kernel launch and host-to-device transfer dominate, competitive only once the
input amortises both. Transfer cost stays inside the measured region — a number
that excludes it would not describe anything a caller can actually get.
